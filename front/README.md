**Food Secure Network** is a web application designed to bridge the gap between food donors (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) and recipients (local charities, shelters). By facilitating real-time surplus food tracking and distribution, the app helps reduce food waste while combating hunger in communities.

## 🌟 Features

- 📦 **Food Donation Management** — Donors can list surplus food items with quantity and pickup details.
- 📍 **Real-Time Tracking** — Track available food donations in real-time on a map.
- 🤝 **Charity Matching System** — Matches available food to the nearest eligible charities or NGOs.
- 📞 **Integrated Contact System** — Enables quick contact between donors and recipients.
- 🔐 **User Roles & Authentication** — Separate dashboards for donors, recipients, and admins.
- 🌐 **Bilingual UI** — English and regional language support for better accessibility.
- 🚚 **Pickup & Delivery Coordination** — Option to mark pickup status and update availability.


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Donor adds food** ➜
2. **System finds closest charities** ➜
3. **Charities confirm availability** ➜
4. **Pickup scheduled** ➜
5. **Food successfully redirected from waste to need!**
