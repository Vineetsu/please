# 🥗 Food Secure Network


**Food Secure Network** is a web application that bridges the gap between food surplus providers (like restaurants and grocery stores) and local charities/shelters. The goal is to reduce food waste and support communities in need through efficient, real-time coordination.

### 📌 How the App Works

- 📝 **Food Providers Register & List Surplus**  
  Restaurants and grocery stores register and upload details about available surplus food, including type, quantity, and expiry time.

- 📡 **Real-Time Updates**  
  The app continuously updates the list of available surplus items in real-time using the backend API and database.

- 🤝 **Charity Login & Request**  
  Registered charities can log in, view available food near them, and place requests based on their needs.

- 🔁 **Matching Engine**  
  A built-in logic engine matches available food to nearby charities based on location, need, and food type.

- 📊 **Admin Dashboard**  
  Admin users can manage food listings, user roles, resolve disputes, and view analytics (e.g., total food rescued, active users).

- 🌍 **Bilingual Support [yet to be added]**  
  Users can toggle between Kannada and English for accessibility and ease of use in local communities.

- 🧺 **Pickup & Record**  
  Once food is picked up, the status is updated, and a record is stored for transparency and audit.
